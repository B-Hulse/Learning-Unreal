# Learning-Unreal
A repo of all the unreal projects I used to learn the software

## Tutorial Project

First project for following a tutorial, will likely have nothing interesting in it

### Goals for the project

* Have a surface level understanding of what UE5 can do, and how to use the basic features
* Add some unique functionality to the game outside of a tutorial
